Project Title: Online Food Ordering Web Application

Team Members: 
1.	Muhammad Usman
2.	Aravind Reddy
3.	Ritwik Reddy
4.	Damodar Reddy


The Story:
Motivation behind developing this application is to facilitate the people with this online application. During the Covid-19 time the e-commerce companies like amazon, boosted their business more than we think about can be and not only it facilitates the business owners to boost their business, also it facilitates the customers to get the thing by just clicking a few buttons. Our application is facilitating the customers in the same way, during and after the covid time. Let’s understand the customers. We are targeting both restaurant owners and as well as food buyers. For restaurant owners our app will help them to boost their business by maximizing the reach of their hotel miles away to customers. Unlike Social media marketing, where the customers will only get to know about the business. Our application will not only marketize their business, also it will allow their target audience to buy the food from their restaurants. For food buyers, this will help allow them to get their favorite food by sitting in their home or in the school and office. In this way buyers will be saving their time and commute cost. This application is having the best features that will results in both sellers and buyers benefit.
The Data:
The data we used in our application is mostly string format data that is the name of customers and restaurants and their corresponding menus. All the restaurant data was collected from the google by visiting each restaurant website.
We used NoSQL database, so our data is non-relational data. To give the high-level overview of over data schema, we have attached the schema of one restaurant from our database.

Improvement: 
In this increment, we mainly fixed some bugs in the admin panel and add new functionality that were not present in the previous sprint. We have discussed the improvement parts below. 
1.	The total of the order has been fixed in this sprint by using the correct sum formula.
2.	In this sprint we have add the functionality, where user can add the restaurants using admin panel. In the previous sprint user must insert the new restaurant detail by visiting the database.
3.	User can now delete the menu from the admin panel, whereas in the previous sprint user cannot delete the menu from the admin panel and if he wanted to delete it, he must need to visit the database to do that.
4.	We have also added the chat bot into our website.
5.	Refactoring of the whole code and we also added appropriate comments.

Work Distribution:

§	Aravind Reddy  & Damodar Reddy is working on the front-end design of the website.

§	All team are working on collecting the data and completing the documentation. 




Issue & Blockages with the Project:
1.	Due to lack of experience of our team members and with short time period, it was difficult to include all the features in our applications. However, we included all the major features that is required for online food ordering app.
2.	Second challenge was to develop the admin panel. We first tried the auto generated Adminbros admin panel that is design for node applications, and we successfully deployed that admin panel. However, there was a problem with iterating the nested array from the database and after discussing with professor Vijaya, we created the admin panel in PHP which was easy, and it was easily connected with the mongodb database. 
3.	In the beginning we are planning to add online grocery stores in our application, but the business logic of online grocery store was not matching with the online food ordering application. If we add grocery stores in our application, then it would become difficult for grocery store owners to maintain their stocks in the database system. Due to this issue, we excluded this feature from our application.
